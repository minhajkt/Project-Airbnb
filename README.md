# Project-Airbnb
A data analysis on an Airbnb dataset of NYC of the year 2019 in Jupyter Notebook and  PowerBI.

First we are looking into the coding part of the data exploration in Jupyter Notebook.
The required Libraries are imported
The dataset to be worked on is imported
A small understanding of the dataset is done using the functions like shape, dtypes, describe 
The 'Reviews per month' column is plotted to check if it is normally distrubuted and skewness is checked and iqr, z score, log is applied to bring the plotting to a normal distribution.
The visualization is done for the listings in neighbourhood group.
Top 10 neighbourhood with maximum listings is plotted on a bar chart.
Types of room is plotted on pie chart and price distribution on a bar chart.
A scatter plot is plotted to the calculated listings count and average price.
The price distribution and average price distribution is plotted on pie charts.
A heatmap is plotted to know the correlation between the numerical columns and a pairplot is also plotted.
A scatterplot is plotted to see the listings according to the locations.

In PowerBI, cards for average price, Listings count, Average minimum nights and maximum price is created.
Slicers for Rooms types, their Availability and Cities is created.
A line chart is plotted to know the sum of max price of listings and the corresponding host name.
A line and stacked column chart is created to visualize the Listings count and average price with respect to the neighbourhood groups.
Types of room is plotted on a donut chart and a map is created to show the listings in NYC.
